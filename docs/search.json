    "section": "Packing Your App",
    "text": "Packing Your App\nTo pack your app, make a new .py file in the same folder as your app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis is easiest if your main app file is in the root (top-level) folder of your repository - if it is not, check out this packing file for an example of how to deal with it.\n\n\nThe pack function converts a Streamlit app into a single index.html file that can be served as a static website.\n\nExample\nfrom stlitepack import pack\n\npack(\n    app_file=\"streamlit_app.py\"\n)\nRunning this will create a new index.html file that is a full stlite app:\ndocs/index.html\nThe package handles all the additional boilerplate html, as well as applying some common stlite-specific corrections that ensure features like streamlit spinners and material-ui icons work correctly.\nBy default, the index.html file is put in the docs folder to keep everything tidy, and because this is a folder github pages can easily be configured to look for.\nAlternatively, you may wish for the output index.html file to be placed in a different subfolder if your chosen static hosting site expects it to be somewhere else.\nfrom stlitepack import pack\n\npack(\n    app_file=\"streamlit_app.py\",\n    output_dir=\"my_other_folder\"\n)\nThis will create:\nmy_other_folder/\n  └── index.html\nIf you want to put it one level up from the current location, you can make your packing file in the same location as the app file (making sure you then run the packing file from that location using the cd command or similar), and then use \"..\" as the path to tell the package to place the output file one level up.\nfrom stlitepack import pack\n\npack(\n    app_file=\"streamlit_app.py\",\n    output_dir=\"..\"\n)\nThis will create:\nindex.html\napp/\n  └── streamlit_app.py\n  └── my_packing_file.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote that if you are hosting on github pages and enabling this via the repository settings, there are only two options for where the index.html file can be stored\n\nyour repository’s ‘root’ folder (i.e. the top-level folder you see when you first open up your repository on github)\nthe docs folder, which must be directly within the root folder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⚠️ Important Note for Local Testing\n\n\n\nIf you open index.html directly in your browser (i.e. via file://), you may see errors like:\nFailed to execute 'pushState' on 'History'\nGET http://stlite.invalid/... net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED\nDon’t worry! These errors are caused by browser security restrictions and do not indicate a problem with the app.\nTo run the app correctly, you need to serve it over HTTP/HTTPS.\nIf you add the argument run_preview_server=True to your packing function, the app will automatically be previewed - though remember to close the server with CTRL + C if you’ve got extra steps in your packing file.\nAlternatively, you can start the server yourself:\nOnce served over HTTP, navigation and media files will work as expected.\nDeploying the app to GitHub Pages or any web server will automatically avoid these errors.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Parameters\nTo package up a Python app, the minimum we need to provide is the name of the main Streamlit app file (which is also known as the ‘entrypoint’). This can be called anything, but must be a .py file.\nIf your app has multiple additional pages stored in a pages subfolder at the same level as your main app file, then they will automatically be included in the output file.\n\nMain Optional Parameters\n\nrequirements\nYou may wish to install some additional python packages.\n\na list of Python package names ([\"pandas\", \"numpy\"]), or\na path to a requirements.txt file.\n\ne.g.\nfrom stlitepack import pack\n\npack(\n    app_file=\"streamlit_app.py\",\n    requirements=[\"matplotlib\", \"numpy\"],\n)\nor\nfrom stlitepack import pack\n\npack(\n    app_file=\"streamlit_app.py\",\n    requirements=\"requirements.txt\",\n)\nIf omitted, no extra packages are installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNote that due to the way packages are managed in stlite, using pyodide and micropip, you may* not be able to ‘pin’ certain dependencies in the way you are used to with streamlit apps.\nMore detail about this will be added soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIn particular, it’s not possible to specify a version of the Streamlit package - this will be ignored by stlite!\nPandas, numpy, scipy and other common packages that are not pure python are other packages where issues may be encountered.\n\n\n\n\ntitle\nThis controls the name of the app that will be displayed when a user has it open in a web browser, showing up as the name of the tab.\nfrom stlitepack import pack\n\npack(\n    app_file=\"streamlit_app.py\",\n    title=\"My Amazing App\"\n)\n\n\nstylesheet_version / js_bundle_version\nVersion numbers of the stlite JavaScript and CSS bundles. Must be valid versions from the stlite releases page. This will control the Streamlit version that is used too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe package will default to “0.80.5”, which is known to be particularly stable.\n\n\nfrom stlitepack import pack\n\npack(\n    app_file=\"streamlit_app.py\",\n    # It's highly recommended to use the same version for both arguments!\n    stylesheet_version=\"0.84.1\",\n    js_bundle_version=\"0.84.1\"\n)\nIf you want to see the list of valid stlite versions:\nfrom stlitepack.pack import get_stlite_versions\n\nget_stlite_versions()\n\n\nextra_files_to_embed\nExtra files (relative paths) to mount inside the app, e.g. a .streamlit/config.toml or extra helper scripts.\ne.g.\nfrom stlitepack import pack\n\npack(\n    app_file=\"streamlit_app.py\",\n    extra_files=[\".streamlit/config.toml\", \"data.csv\"]\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote that this must be passed as a list of strings (even if you’re only adding one extra file this way).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAlso note that you don’t need to manually add extra app pages from your pages subfolder this way - they will automatically be picked up when you pass in the path of your main/entrypoint file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAt present, this only really works with text-based files, like .py, .toml, .yml, .csv, etc.\nIt will try to convert binary file types like .jpg, .png, .mp4 etc. into an embeddable format, but this is experimental and will increase the size of your index.html file significantly\nIf you need to include these kinds of files, it’s recommended to use extra_files_to_link instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nextra_files_to_link\nAdditional files to hyperlink to. - If passed as a list, must be used with the argument ‘prepend_github_path’. The list must be a list of relative filepaths. - If passed as a dict, expects key:value pairs of relative_filepath: url\ne.g. {‘img/my_img.png’: ’https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-github-username/your-github-repository/refs/heads/main/img/my_img.png}\n\nprepend_github_path\nIf files to be linked are stored on github, you can pass them as relative paths in the ‘extra_files_to_link’ argument, and then use this argument to automatically generate the url links to the files in your repository.\nNeeds to passed in the format “username/reponame” e.g. a username of Bergam0t with a reponame of my-streamlit-app would be “Bergam0t/my-streamlit-app”\nThen, for example, if you passed a list of [‘img/my_img.png’] to the ‘extra_files_to_link’ argument, it would automatically generate the url of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bergam0t/my-streamlit-app/refs/heads/main/img/my_img.png\n\n\ngithub_branch\nIf files to be linked to on Github need to come from a branch other than main, provide the name of the desired branch here. e.g. a username of Bergam0t with a reponame of my-streamlit-app would be “Bergam0t/my-streamlit-app”\nIf you passed ‘dev’ as your branch to this argument, and then passed a list of [‘img/my_img.png’] to the ‘extra_files_to_link’ argument, it would automatically generate the url of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bergam0t/my-streamlit-app/refs/heads/dev/img/my_img.png\n\n\n\nrun_preview_server\nSetting run_preview_server to true will automatically preview your stlite app in a new browser window so you can check it works as expected.\nRremember to close the server with CTRL + C if you’ve got extra steps in your packing file.",

    "text": "Publishing with GitHub Pages\nUse setup_github_pages() to scaffold a GitHub Pages deployment for your packaged stlite app.\nIt creates the necessary files and prints step-by-step instructions (also saved to PAGES_SETUP.md).\n\nPrerequisites\n\nYou have a GitHub account and a repository for your app.\nYou know which branch you’ll publish from (default: main).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGitHub Basics\n\n\n\n\nRepositories are project folders hosted on GitHub. You’ll need to push your code there first.\nBranches are parallel versions of your repository (most often \"main\").\nGitHub Pages is a free hosting service for static sites from your repo.\n\n\n\n\n\nTypical workflow\nfrom stlitepack import pack, setup_github_pages\n\n# 1) Pack your app into docs/index.html (recommended for Pages)\npack(\n    app_file=\"streamlit_app.py\",\n    requirements=[\"matplotlib\"],\n    output_dir=\"docs\"\n)\n\n# 2) Scaffold GitHub Pages\nsetup_github_pages(\n    mode=\"gh-actions\",     # or \"manual\"\n    use_docs=True,         # serve from /docs (recommended) - matches the pack default\n    only_on_index=True,    # only trigger a pages rebuild when index.html changes\n    branch=\"main\"\n)\n\n# 3) Follow the printed instructions (also saved to PAGES_SETUP.md).\n\n\nWhat the function creates\n\nA .nojekyll file in the repo root (disables Jekyll so files are served as-is).\nA 404.html file in the same folder as your index.html file (due to the way navigation works in stlite, this ensures users won’t see a 404 page not found error when refreshing while on a subpage of your app, or if they share or bookmark a link to a subpage)\nIf mode=\"gh-actions\":\n\nA workflow file at .github/workflows/deploy.yml.\nA PAGES_SETUP.md helper with the exact steps to enable Pages via GitHub Actions.\n\nIf mode=\"manual\":\n\nA PAGES_SETUP.md helper with exact steps to configure Deploy from a branch.\n\n\n\n\nFinishing steps (by mode)\nThese are also given in PAGES_SETUP.md, but are reproduced here for simplicity\n\nIf mode=\"manual\"\n\nCommit index.html, .nojekyll and 404.html\nIn Repo → Settings → Pages:\n\nBuild and deployment → Source: Deploy from a branch\nBranch: your branch (e.g., main)\nFolder: /docs (if use_docs=True) or root (if use_docs=False)\n\n\n\n\nIf mode=\"gh-actions\"\n\nIn Repo → Settings → Pages:\n\nBuild and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nMake sure you enable this before committing the files!\nIf you do not, it will not trigger a build when first enabled without you forcibly making a change to index.html and committing/pushing that change.\n\n\n\nCommit the generated files:\n\n.github/workflows/deploy.yml\n.nojekyll\n404.html\nindex.html in your target folder (docs/ if use_docs=True, else repo root).\n\nPush to your repo. The workflow will build and deploy your site.\n\n\n\nBoth\nYour app will be available at:\nhttps://&lt;your-github-username&gt;.github.io/&lt;your-repo-name&gt;/\n\nNote: It can take a few minutes for the first deployment to appear. If using Actions, ensure the workflow runs and passes; if using manual mode, double-check your Pages settings.\n\n\nOptional - add a link to your deployed app to the ‘About’ section of your repository\nOnce you have followed the instructions, head over to the ‘about’ section of your repository and click on the cog.\n\nTick ‘Use your GitHub Pages website’ - your will likely take the form ‘https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name’\n\nThen click ‘save changes’\n\nYou can then click the link to head to your hosted app.\n\nIf the app has built successfully, there will be a green tick next to your last commit message:",
